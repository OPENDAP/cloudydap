Aggregation Emulation

In this directory find shell scripts that are designed to emulate simple 
aggregation requests without utilizing the ncml_handler.


README - This file

aggTestAirs - Performs a simulation of a single DAP resquest that spans 366
AIRS data files, requesting a single value from the "Temparature_A" array 
variablefrom each file.

aggTestMerra2 - Performs a simulation of a single DAP resquest that spans 439
MERRA2 data files, requesting a single value from the "PRECCU" array variable
from each file.


aggTestProcessor - This code does the heavy lifting for the emulation utilizing
besstandalone and not bescmdln which relies on network access to interact with 
the BES. Since the user, and later, the OLFS make a single request that is
transmitted to the BES using bescmdln in this test would only serve to amplify
any network latency issues by making 100s of requests.

airs_AggFiles - Contains a list of granule names that define the aggregation 
accessed by the aggTestAirs script.
 
merra2_AggFiles - Contains a list of granule names that define the aggregation 
accessed by the aggTestMerra2 script.

traverseCollection - Utilizes the embeded index.xml files in our S3 bucket to
pull data from each file in a collection. A single constraint is utilized. This
code is not currently used because the organization of our S3 bucket failed to 
group datasets into logical collections of semantically related granules. Oh. Well.
